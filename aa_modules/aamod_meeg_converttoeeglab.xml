            subject can be specified as cell array of strings or '*' (for all)
            to modify events or data
                event can be a single event or a 1xN array indicating events in the event list
                valid operations are
                    'remove' - remove
                    'keep' - remove all others
                    'unique:first' - keep only first of consecutive events
                    'unique:last' - keep only last of consecutive events
                    'rename:<new type>' - rename event(s) to <new type>
                    'iterate' - add suffix to recurring event to indicate the number of occurrence
                    'insert:[<array of indices>] - insert event before the locations specified by <array of indices> with timings of the events at the locations'
                    'inserteachbetween:<start event>:<step in sec>:<end event>' - insert events at each <step in sec> between <start event> and <end event>
                    'ignorebefore' - remove heading data before the first occurence (excluding the event)
                    'ignoreafter' - remove trailig data after the last occurence (including the event)
